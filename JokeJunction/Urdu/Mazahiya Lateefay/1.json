A man sees a sign in front of a house: "Talking Dog for Sale." Intrigued, he knocks on the door. The owner invites him in and points to the dog in the corner.
"So, what can you do?" the man asks the dog.
"I can talk," the dog replies.
The man is shocked. "Wow! Tell me your story."
The dog sighs. "I discovered I could talk as a puppy. I worked with the CIA, traveling the world, eavesdropping on bad guys. But I got tired of the high-stakes life, so I retired to a quiet life here."
The man turns to the owner, amazed. "How much do you want for this dog?"

"Ten dollars?! Why so cheap?"
The owner shakes his head. "Because he's a liar! He didn’t do any of that!""},

    {"joke": "Once there was a man who went to an exotic country and came across a stall selling handmade handheld fans. He asked for the prettiest and longest-lasting one and the owner charged him a whopping $1,000! After using it the first time, it broke so he took it back for a refund.

The owner listened to the complaints and finally asked him how he used the fan. The man demonstrated flapping the fan as one would normally do.

Then the owner said, "Ah! No wonder! You have been using the fan wrong. This is the way to use it."
Then, he held the fan and frantically moved his head left and right."},

The parrot, shivering, says, "I’m so sorry for being rude. I’ve learned my lesson."

    {"joke": "The Pope and the Rabbi: 
Long ago, the Pope decreed all Jews in the Vatican must convert or leave. A wise rabbi challenged the Pope to a silent debate. They faced off: the Pope raised three fingers; the rabbi raised one. The Pope spun his finger; the rabbi pointed to the ground. The Pope took out bread and wine; the rabbi took out an apple.
The Pope admitted defeat, saying the rabbi's symbolic responses were too wise. Meanwhile, the rabbi explained to his followers: "He showed three fingers for the Trinity; I showed one for one God. He spun his hand to show God rules the heavens; I pointed down to show God is also here. He showed bread and wine; I showed the apple from Eden!"​
