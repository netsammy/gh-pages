\"Yep,\" the dog replies.\n
\"That's amazing! Tell me your story.\"\n
The dog says, \"Well, I discovered my gift of talking as a pup and wanted to serve my country. I worked for the CIA as a top-secret spy. I traveled the world, eavesdropping on conversations, and helped catch bad guys. When I got older, I decided to settle down and became a therapy dog at a hospital. And now I’m retired.\"\n
The man is stunned. He returns to the owner and asks, \"How much for the dog?\"\n
\"Ten dollars.\"\n
\"Only ten dollars? Why so cheap?\"\n
